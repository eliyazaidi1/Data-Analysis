###working with a simple dummy data set that contains factory production values of electrical machinery parts for a corporation.

### **Task:**

To Calculate Production values as per the days and existing infrastructure?

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('/content/Factory_Production.csv',index_col='Factory')
df

To Calculate Production values as per the days and existing infrastructure?

# **Matrix Multiplication**


#### Feature Description:
This data set contains the production values of power units such as generators, motors and cables of different factories belonging to the same corporation.

- Factory = unique label assigned to a factory unit for the purpose of identification
- Generators = number of generators produced by the factory in a day
- Motors = number of motors produced by the factory in a day
- Cables = number of cables produced by the factory in a day
- Days = number of working days of the factory in a year

##### Study its features such as:
- The number of factory units
- The number of machine parts
- The ranges of production values

## Task 2 - Extract production values as a matrix from the data

- The factory production values for each factory are contained in the "Generators", "Motors" and "Cables" features
- These production values will form a 10 x 3 matrix (considering all factories)

df_prod = df.drop('Days',axis=1)
df_prod

## Task 3 - Extract number of working days as a matrix from the data

- The number of working days for each factory is stored in the "Days" column of the data frame "df"
- These values will form a 10 x 1 matrix

df_day = df['Days']
df_day

## Task 4 - Multiply matrices

- The factory production values of generators, motors and cables of the 10 factories is a 10 x 3 matrix
- The number of working days of all the factories is in the form of a 1 x 10 matrix
- The product of these two matrices is equal to the linear combination of the production values vectors scaled by the number of working days

A = np.matrix(df_prod)
X = np.matrix(df_day)


A.shape

X.shape

## Task 5 - Code a linear combination of vectors using addition and scalar multiplication

- The vector of daily production values for a certain factory can be accessed from the data frame "df_prod".
- The number of working days in a year for each factory can be extracted from the data frame "df".
- The total production of a certain factory in a full year can be obtained using scalar multiplication.

data = np.array(X@A)
data = data.flatten()
dp = pd.Series(data,index=df_prod.columns)
